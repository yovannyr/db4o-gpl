	/// An ObjectSet is a representation for a set of objects returned  by a query.
	/// <br /><br />
	/// ObjectSet extends the list interface. It is
	/// recommended to never reference ObjectSet directly in code but to use the list interface instead.
	/// <br /><br />
	/// Note that the underlying
	/// <see cref="IObjectContainer">IObjectContainer</see>
	/// of an ObjectSet
	/// needs to remain open as long as an ObjectSet is used. This is necessary
	/// for lazy instantiation. The objects in an ObjectSet are only instantiated
	/// when they are actually being used by the application. In case you want to use a query
	/// result after the object container has been closed, you need to copy the result set.
	/// </remarks>
